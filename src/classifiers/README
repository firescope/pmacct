INTRODUCTION.
pmacct 0.10.0 sees the introduction of IPv4/IPv6 traffic classification capabilities. The goal is being able to identify
and classify flows (traffic is meant to be a set of flows) in a dynamical way, ie. understanding the network application
they belong to and not just relying upon TCP/UDP port numbers. This latter approach, in fact, has two critical points:
it can be easily circumvented from users by using non-standard ports for their applications and it's unable to deal with
applications that allocate dynamic data channels (ie. file transfers, IP telephony, P2P, etc.).

Among the others, traffic classification can result highly beneficial for:
  a) network planning and provisioning by determining services, quantities and peers involved;
  b) accounting and billing per application layer logical entities (ie. virtual hosts);
  c) detecting suspicious activities and either forbidden or just bandwidth hungry applications.

This package includes some classifiers ready to be compiled as dynamic shared objects (SO). Follow the instructions in
the INSTALL document for compilation and installation. More details (ie. measure of accuracy and time to execution for
available classifiers) will be included as they emerge. For further details take a look to the pmacct classification
