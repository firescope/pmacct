COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION.
Some generic steps needed to compile correctly the package follow: 

a) edit the Makefile changing, if required, the CC value (by default it's gcc)
   and LIBS value (by default -ldl but some systems - ie. FreeBSD - don't need
   it. Then run the Makefile:
 
   shell> Makefile 

b) move the desired shared object in the proper location:

   shell> mv <file>.so /path/to/classifiers/

c) configure and run pmacct
